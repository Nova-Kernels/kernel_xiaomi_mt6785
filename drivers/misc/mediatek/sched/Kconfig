config MTK_SCHED_INTEROP
	bool "mtk scheduling interopation enhancement"
	default y
	help
	   Original Linux Design, RT & CFS do load balance seperatedly,
	   and let would result in unload balance.
	   that is, one CPU has more than 2 tasks, however, one CPU is IDLE
	   We make RT & CFS to check each other and make load more balance.

config MTK_SCHED_TRACE

	  load balance information at kernel log.
	  Say no if not sure.

	  Default is sorting the CPU domain from little to Big.
	  This KCONFIG will support to prefer to
	  put BL in Big domain for performance/power/thermal
	  and so on consideration.

config SCHED_HMP
	bool "Heterogenous multiprocessor scheduling"

	depends on SCHED_MC && FAIR_GROUP_SCHED && !SCHED_AUTOGROUP
	help
	  Scheduler optimizations for heterogeneous platforms.
	  Attempts to introspectively select task affinity to
	  optimize power and performance. Basic support for multiple (>2)
	  cpu types is in place, but it has only been tested with two
	  types of cpus.
	  There is currently no support for migration of task groups, hence
	  !SCHED_AUTOGROUP.

config SCHED_HMP_PRIO_FILTER
	bool "(EXPERIMENTAL) Filter HMP migrations by task priority"
	default y
	depends on SCHED_HMP
	help
	  Enables task priority based HMP migration filter. Any task with
	  a NICE value above the threshold will always be on low-power cpus
	  with less compute capacity.
	  If unsure say N here.

config SCHED_HMP_PRIO_FILTER_VAL

config HMP_FREQUENCY_INVARIANT_SCALE
	bool "(EXPERIMENTAL) Frequency-Invariant Tracked Load for HMP"
	depends on !ARCH_SCALE_INVARIANT_CPU_CAPACITY
	help
	  Scales the current load contribution in line with the frequency
	  of the CPU that the task was executed on.
	  In this version, we use a simple linear scale derived from the
	  maximum frequency reported by CPUFreq.
	  Restricting tracked load to be scaled by the CPU's frequency
	  represents the consumption of possible compute capacity
	  (rather than consumption of actual instantaneous capacity as
	  normal) and allows the HMP migration's simple threshold
	  migration strategy to interact more predictably with CPUFreq's
	  asynchronous compute capacity changes.

config SCHED_HMP_PLUS
	bool "(EXPERIMENTAL) Corepilot enhancement"
	depends on SCHED_HMP
	default y
	help
	  Corepilot hmp enhancement.
	  1. Do hmp_idle_pull at idle_balance
	  2. At global balance, consider the tasks in rq,
	  move heaviest/lightest of first 5 tasks in rq.
	  3. Enhance down migration rule: Do not migrate task when big core
	  is idle
